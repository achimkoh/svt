Work in progress. Check the current working version here: [link](/sws)

In Spring 2015 I participated in the [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io). My logs of those times are [here](http://akkakkak.tumblr.com/). For my final project at sfpc I made an openFrameworks port of [Sonic Wire Sculptor](http://www.sonicwiresculptor.com/) by [Amit Pitaru](http://pitaru.com), which is in [my Github repo](https://github.com/achimkoh/sfpcSpring2015). 

<!-- Below is a new p5.js port of sws. It is a work in progress, still lacks many functionalities that make the original tool interesting, like tilting the angle of the whole drawing. You can play around by clicking and dragging. Pressing the numbers 1 ~ 4 will change the next sound slightly. Z deletes the most recent line. A bit buggy on mobile, unfortunately.
