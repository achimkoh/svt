In Spring 2015 I participated in the [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io). My logs of those times are [here](http://akkakkak.tumblr.com/). For my final project at sfpc I made an openFrameworks port of [Sonic Wire Sculptor](http://www.sonicwiresculptor.com/) by [Amit Pitaru](http://pitaru.com), which is in [my Github repo](https://github.com/achimkoh/sfpcSpring2015).

	Below is a new p5.js port of sws. You can play around by clicking and dragging, if you are using a mouse. Pressing the numbers 1 ~ 4 will change the next sound slightly. Backspace is supposed to delete the most recent line, but it will cause the browser to go back to the previous page... Need to fix.
	<div id="p5-container">
		<script src="{{site.baseurl}}/js/p5/libraries/p5.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src="{{site.baseurl}}/js/p5/libraries/p5.dom.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src="{{site.baseurl}}/js/p5/libraries/p5.sound.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src="{{site.baseurl}}/js/p5/sws.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
	</div>
	Note to self: need to give parent to canvas, otherwise script will appear after footer. See: [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Beyond-the-canvas).
