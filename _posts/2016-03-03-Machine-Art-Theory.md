Trying to better think about the implications of recent AI trends in arts and other humanities field. For example, do recent developments in machine learning open up different aesthetic possibilities than what has been explored by algorithmic art / media art / etc? Are the increased computational power and amount of accessible data the fundamental difference, or is there something more at play here?

Concerns such as [Boyd's][boyd] call for a critical thinking of machine learning and the way it is implemented. What then would be the technological practice which incorporates such thinking? How does the thinking translate into/from technology? This is subject to lots of theoretical, artistic and theoretical exploration.
