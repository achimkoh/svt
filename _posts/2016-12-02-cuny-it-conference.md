I presented at the [15th Annual CUNY IT Conference](http://www.centerdigitaled.com/events/CUNY-IT-Conference.html) about my upcoming project that tries to bridge technical and critical resources concerning machine learning that are out there. Here are the slides: [pdf]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/cunyitconference16_koh.pdf)

I plan to start with a simple readings list, and get something moving in early 2017. More on this later!

To do: add nycdh workshop as well. Merge into one ML primer article.
