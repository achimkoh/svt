some stuff i made, mostly by stealing or imitating other people's stuff. Below is a p5.js port of [Sonic Wire Sculptor](http://www.sonicwiresculptor.com/) by [Amit Pitaru](http://pitaru.com). I had made an [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) version while participating in [sfpc](http://sfpc.io), which can be found in my github. You can play around by clicking and dragging, if you are using a mouse. Pressing the numbers 1 ~ 4 will change the next sound slightly. Backspace is supposed to delete the most recent line, but it will cause the browser to go back to the previous page... Need to fix.

Note to self: need to give parent to canvas, otherwise script will appear after footer. See: [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Beyond-the-canvas).
