#Machine Learning

---
class: middle

methods for: 

- pattern detection
- prediction
- decision making

---
class: middle


finding mathematical functions

automatic (not handcrafting)

-> large & complex data e.g. quantifying kissinger, topic modeling

---
class: middle

###Many tools we use already rely on ML

- USPS OCR
- Spam filters
- Facebook feeds
- Google Translate
- Face recognition

---
class: middle

when a service asks you to provide small feedback throughout its system, it's probably asking you to train its ML algorithm

---
class: middle

###"training"

or, building a prejudice box

---
class: middle

###data source

what are the data that exist?

where do they come from?

---
class: middle

###representation

need for quantification

feature reduction

- what are important features?

---
class: middle

###learning methods

different algorithms work better or worse for different data

---
class: middle


###many resources are problem-solving oriented

- they tend to be technical (learn how to implement X in Y)

---
class: middle

###discussions

- e.g. algorithmic society, biases in data

---
class: center, middle

###a place to address both

#Critical Machine Learning

---
class: middle

###Help familiarize with concepts and assumptions of ML

<br>

###Think critically about its implications

---
class: center, middle

###Components

<br>

Website

Workshops

---
class: middle

###Website

- Tutorials
- Readings list

---
class: middle

###Workshop Session 1

- intro to concepts and assumptions
- simple hands-on exercise

---
class: middle

###Workshop Session 2

- "critical" exercise: making the algorithm fail
- discussion about pitfalls and critical issues

---
class: middle

python + scikit-learn

DH Box

- easy to prepare
- slow, but it's okay

---
