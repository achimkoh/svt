Headlines like ["Google Wants to Train Other Companies to Use Its AI Tools"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-19/google-wants-to-train-other-companies-to-use-its-ai-tools) reflect the way we talk about corporate entities as having their own will, their own desires. This is the case in media reports as well as in our everyday conversation. This project explores the corporate "desires" reflected in public enuncitations.

"Desires" are extracted by scraping public twitter posts containing company names and certain phrases, like "wants to." An early visualization shows words most frequently following the search phrase, by company.

For the next step, I am considering ways to visualize the change of topics of the desires as time flows.
