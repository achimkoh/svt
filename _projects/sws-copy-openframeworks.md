Interactive installation , 2015

This was my final project for the School for Poetic Computation student showcase. I found myself oddly attracted to digital art from the early 2000s, and I decided to port [a work previously made by one of our teachers, Amit Pitaru](http://sonicwiresculptor.com/). By choosing to do this project, I put myself in a comparative perspective between the current technological context (using the openFrameworks C++ library) and the past context (from the times of Flash and ActionScript); moreover, I could imagine, at least a little bit, the situation when the original work was touring worldwide—the amazement of spectators and technical troubles popping up. The process of recreating a work and exhibiting it was more insightful than I expected.
